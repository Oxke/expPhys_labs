\begin{abstract}

In the first laboratory the general objectives were to appropriately configure
instruments to make resistance measurements, verify Ohm’s law and to measure
the current voltage characterization of a non-linear device. In order to make
the measurement we studied DC-fed circuits constructing the voltage current
characteristic of the two different devices, that is to say an Ohmic conductor
and a non-Ohmic conductor, the first one a resistor, the latter a diode.

\chapter{Measurement of the current-voltage characteristic of a resistor}
\section{Goal}
In the first part of the experiment, we want to evaluate the best instrument
configuration for the circuits given, verify Ohm’s law using the results
obtained, and measure the composite resistances in parallel and in series of the
circuit.

\section{Setup}

The setup for the experiment is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:setup_exp1}.

        diagrams, one for each of the two circuits. On the bottom are shown two
    photos, one for each of the two setups}\label{fig:setup_exp1}
\end{figure}



\section{Method}
\subsection{Evaluation of the best instrument configuration}
In order to do the evaluation, we set up all the devices necessary to recreate
the first circuit (image~\ref{fig:setup1.13}). With the aim of analyzing the best instrument
configuration, we need to find the value of the voltmeter's internal resistance
$R_V$ for setup 1 (image~\ref{fig:setup1.11}) and the ammeter's internal resistance $R_A$ for
setup 2 (image~\ref{fig:setup1.12}). For $R_V$, we need to apply Ohm’s law to the parallel of
resistors $R$ and $R_V$, and for $R_A$, to the series of resistors $R$ and
$R_A$.

After connecting every element, we started to try different values of the
resistance ($R_{box}$) and the $V_{battery}$ produced by the power supply, in
both setups. We obtained some values of $V$ (detected voltage) on the fluke and
of the current (detected current). With these detections, we calculated firstly the
resistance of the circuit using Ohm’s law:
\[ R_\text{detected}  = \frac{V_\text{detected} }{I_\text{detected} } \]

Using the found values of $R$, it was possible to calculate the voltmeter’s
internal resistance $R_V$ and the ammeter’s internal resistance $R_A$. We
arrived at these results using the equivalent resistance derived from Ohm’s law.
For $R_V$, we used the formula for resistors in parallel, and for $R_A$, the
formula for resistors in series:
\begin{equation}
    R_V = {\left( \frac{1}{R_\text{detected} } - \frac{1}{R_\text{box} }
    \right)} ^{-1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    R_A = R_\text{detected}  - R_\text{box}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Which of the two circuits is more suitable for measuring ``small''
resistances and which for ``large'' resistances}
Circuit (I) is more suitable for small resistances, while circuit (II) is better
for large resistances because in this way their internal resistances are
irrelevant. To prove this point, we analyzed the opposite case:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For circuit (I), we used large resistances and found that we have a constant internal resistance of the voltmeter ($R_V$). Since we found an internal resistance, we proved that, to have a negligible one, we need to use small resistances.
    \item For circuit (II), we used small resistances and found that we have a constant internal resistance of the ammeter ($R_A$). Since we found an internal resistance, we proved that, to have a negligible one, we need to use large resistances.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification of Ohm’s law}
To check the validity of Ohm’s law, we used the values of $V_{battery}$ and $R_{box}$. Then, we calculated the current using the inverse of Ohm’s law:
\[ I = \frac{V}{R} \]
We observed that increasing the resistance results in a larger difference from the calculated and expected values.

\subsection{Measurement of composite resistances}
We picked resistors with values of 220. When in parallel, they become 110; when
in series, they become 440. With the values obtained using all the instruments,
we compared the two values of the resistance. The data table is shown in
Table~\ref{fig:composite}



\chapter{Measurement of the current-voltage characteristic of a diode}
\section{Goal}
Now we want to measure the current-voltage characteristic of a diode, which
should not be linear. Indeed, according to Shockley's law, it is exponential:
\[
    I = I_0 \left( e^{\frac{qV}{gkT}} - 1 \right)
\]
where $I_0$ is the reverse saturation current, $q$ is the electron charge, \(k\)
is the Boltzmann constant, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(g\) is the diode
type-dependent constant. In this chapter we will try to verify this law.

Moreover for practical applications it's common practice to define the diode's
\emph{threshold voltage} as the voltage at which the diode starts conducting a
``significant'' current. We will try to measure this value as well.

\section{Method}
Using a similar setup as the one in part one, we recorded the measured values of
current at different voltages. The setup is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:setup-diode}, where the voltmeter is a handheld Fluke
multimeter and the ammeter is a Agilent bench multimeter.

    \caption{Setup of the diode experiment: on the left the diagram showing
    the circuit made, on the right a photo of the setup}\label{fig:setup-diode}
\end{figure}

Later, in section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we will perform various fits to the data to
verify the exponential relation and estimate the values of the parameters.

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}
The data we collected is shown in table and represented graphically in
figure~\ref{fig:diode-data}. The bench multimeter for the current measurements
had an accuracy of \(\pm 0.05\% + 0.05\mu A\) in the \(500 \mu A\) range; and
the handheld multimeter had an accuracy of \(\pm 0.5\% + 0.002V\) in the \(2 V\)
range.

\end{tikzpicture}
       \caption{Data collected for the diode}\label{fig:diode-data}
   \end{figure}
   from the graph in figure~\ref{fig:diode-data} we can already see that after a
   certain voltage value (about 2.4) the graph follows accurately an exponential
   relationship, as expected. The previous values are very low in current and
   have a greater error. We will perform the analysis only on the part of the
   data which shows a clear exponential behavior, that is for voltages greater
   than \(2.399\) and currents greater than \(1.74\mu A\) (medium values).
   \section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}   

   \subsection{Shockley's law}
    We used the following approximation:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:approx}
        \ln {(e^{x} - 1)} \approx x \quad \text{for } x \gg 1
    \end{equation}
    so that we could linearize the relationship as
    \[
        I = I_0 \left( e^{\frac{qV}{gkT}} - 1 \right) \approx I_0
        e^{\frac{qV}{gkT}} \implies \log I \approx \frac{q}{gkT} V + \log I_{0}
    \]
    Then we performed a linear regression on the data, with the errors on \(V\).
    We decided to keep the error only in the independent variable since it was
    much greater than the one in the dependent variable. 
   in \texttt{R} we ran the following commands:
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=1, lastline=6]{../analysis.r}
   obtaining the following result:
   \begin{verbatim}
Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)  -66.698      1.294  -51.55   <2e-16 ***
Vdetapprox    28.215      0.509   55.44   <2e-16 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 44.5 on 19 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.9939, Adjusted R-squared:  0.9935 
F-statistic:  3073 on 1 and 19 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16  
   \end{verbatim}
   So we can very confidently say that the relation between the current and the
   voltage is exponential. The formula is then:
   \begin{align*}
       \log I_{0} = -67 \pm 1 &\implies I_{0} = 10^{-29} \pm 
       10^{-29} \mu A\\
       \frac{q}{gkT} = 28.2 \pm 0.5 &\implies g = \frac{38.6}{28.2} \mp
       \frac{0.5}{28.2^2} = 1.368 \pm 0.006\\
       I \approx 1e-29 e^{\frac{q}{kT} \cdot \frac{1}{1.368} \cdot V} &= 10^{-29}
       e^{28.2 V} \mu A
   \end{align*}
   (We did not take the measurement for the temperature, so actually 38.6 here
   should not obviously be a constant, but as we don't have the measurement, we
   considered it as such, consequently the error on \(g\) is much smaller than
   the one it should be).
   In figure~\ref{fig:fit} we can see in a graph the accuracy of the fit. Now we
   can justify the approximation~\eqref{eq:approx} as indeed for \(V \ge 2.4\)
   we clearly have that the exponent \(\frac{qV}{gkT} \ge 67.68 \gg 1\), more
   precisely, if \(f, g: [67.68, \infty)\) are respectively the functions \(x
   \mapsto \ln {(e^{x} - 1)}\) and \(x \mapsto x\) then
   \[
       \|f - g\|_{\infty} = |{(f - g)}{(67.68)}| \approx 4.05 \cdot 10^{-30}
   \]
   \paragraph{Chi-squared test} Finally, we performed a \(\rchi^2\)  test on the
   residuals of the fit to see if the errors were independent and normally
   distributed (assuming homoscedasticity), which is what we expect:
   \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=21]{../analysis.r}
   Which returns a p-value of \(0.29 > 0.05\), so we can't reject the null
   hypothesis that the errors are independent and the fit is good.

\section{Threshold voltage}
As explained before, the \emph{threshold voltage} is said to be the voltage at
which a diode starts conducting a ``significant'' current. It's obtained by
fitting the data as a linear relationship and then taking the x-intercept of the
line. To decide how many points to take out of the selected ones, we will
perform the \(\rchi^2\)  test to see if the residuals are independent normal
random variables. The null hypothesis for each value of \(l\) (the number of
points) is that the errors are independent and normally distributed, while the
alternative hypothesis is that they are not. We will then take the biggest \(l\)
such that we can't reject the null hypothesis. In \texttt{R} code this is:
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=8, lastline=20]{../analysis.r}
obtaining that we need to keep the last 9 points. Finally we calculated the
\(V\)-coordi\-nate of the fitting line of those 9 points. Since we know from the
linear model that the line has equation \(i = mv + q\), with \(m\) and \(q\)
parameters saved in the variable \texttt{diode.lm\_threshold\$coefficients}, and
we obtain
\begin{align*}
    q &= -10.3 \pm 0.6 \,mA \quad m = 4.1 \pm 0.2 \,mA / V \\
    \implies V_{\text{threshold}} &= \frac{10.3}{4.1} \pm \sqrt{\left(
    \frac{0.6}{-10.3} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{0.2}{4.1} \right)^2} = 2.50 \pm
     0.8\,V
\end{align*}

\section{Conclusion}
A clear improvement would be to measure the temperature of
the room in order to have a more precise value of the constant \(g\). Moreover,
If we had more datapoints, we could have performed a more accurate fit and have
smaller errors. 

That said, we have successfully verified Shockley's law for a diode and
estimated the value of the parameters. We also measured the threshold voltage of
the diode. The results are consistent with the theory: for silicon diodes the
ideality factor \(g\) should be between 1 and 2, and the threshold voltage makes
sense that is around \(2.5V\), since our diode was a blue LED, so if we see the
threshold voltage as the voltage at which the LED starts emitting light, the
first photon has energy \(E = h\nu\) with \(\nu = c/\lambda \), \(c\) the speed of light and \(h\) Planck's constant. If we
add \(E = qV_\text{threshold}  \) and solve for the wavelength \(\lambda\) we get
\[
    \lambda = \frac{hc}{qV_\text{threshold}  } \approx 496 \, nm
\]
which is in the range of blue light.
